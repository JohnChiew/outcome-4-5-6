 			1. Explain the factors that affect the file size of an image: number of colours, file compression, physical pixel dimensions, file type.
 			<br>	
 			Answer:
 		</h3>
 			<p>
 				One of the factors that affect the file size of an image is file compression. File compression is to make the file smaller, it is the process of reducing the size of a file. Compression can be lossy or lossless. Lossless means the file size is compressed but the picture quality remains the same. Lossy means the compression will lost data.

				Advantages of PNG over GIF, transparency. In GIF file, only one colour is transparent colour. GIF files will producing halo effects when user used differrent background colours that are differrent from the halo effect colours. Then, PNG file have stronger transparency support, with an 8-bit alpha mask. PNG file format also supports full alpha transparency, allowing you to create graphics with different levels of transparency.

 			3. Describe the common methods to optimise images download size and number or requests from web server.
 			<br>
 			Answer:
 		</h3>
 			<p>
 				The common methods to optimise images is compression. Comperssion is to make file smaller ,so that user can speed up to load a page and makes download times shorter. This method can optimise image file and other big file so when other user want to download it would be easy.
